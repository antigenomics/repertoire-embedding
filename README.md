# Repertoire sequencing data embedding tools

Simple scripts for embedding of immune repertoires represented as frequency-V-D-J-CDR3 clonotype tables:

* Mapping of repertoires to a database of reference clonotypes
* Prototype-based embedding optimized for repertoires (accounting for V/J, etc) to real space
* 10X/decode data embedding
* Hamming graphs for repertoires, community detection
* Kmer-based representation of repertoires (smart K-mer family clustering)
